# PYOINV
Based on BIOINV 2.2 (Alvarez-Padilla et. al., 2020) to automate the production of standardized faunistic inventories on the web.

Run the script using main.py. A recent version of python is required (3.0 and above) and the module pandas to be installed. Anaconda is a good way to start.

main.py, like .bat from BIOINV uses information from three sources:
- A directory tree that reflects the taxonomic classification of the organisms and ends at the species level with a catalog of images of given species/morphospecies
- A standardized nomenclature for the species names
- Excel database relating the data with geographical and taxonomical information for the species
